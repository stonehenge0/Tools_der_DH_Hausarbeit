### Visualizations

How can you effectively communicate your takeaways (probably from statistical analysis) visually?
I.e., what kinds of visual representations are suitable for your project?
Will they be included in a dashboard-like part of your interface, or non-interactive infographics?
With what libraries will you implement this?

## Installation and Usage

See `requirements.txt` for a full list of requirements.
The fastest way to install the requirements is using [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing) and a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) (like [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).
> Make sure to substitute <name_of_vev> with an actual name for your environment.

```sh
python3 -m venv <name_of_venv>
source <name_of_venv>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
